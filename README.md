# Electron-Plasma-Temperature-Lab


The codes and data for determining the electron plasma temperature are here. We used Molybdenum wire with a large current under vacuum to generate the plasma and a electron retarding potential analyzer to measure the temperatrue. We took the signal of the ERPA which is proprotional to the current of the electron plasma, and plotted that against the signal going in. This gave an exponetial relation and the temperature is proportional to the growth rate of the function.
